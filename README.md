The Slimbook RGB Keyboard app enables full customization of your built-in light bar (where available) and keyboard backlight color, brightness and visual effects.

This app depends on thre packages of our repository, so, if you want to nstall it without adding our repository, you will need to install manually

Here is a [link](https://slimbook.es/en/tutoriales/aplicaciones-slimbook/501-en-slimbook-rgb-keyboard-3-0) to the app tutorial!

Also, if you have a Slimbook Titan or similar laptop, and you'd like to customize the light; you can find a template inside the folder src/animations, you just need to change the RGB values and save the file inside your local SlimbookRGB animation folder (path: "/usr/share/slimbookrgbkeyboard/src/animations"). 
You will probably have to do it from your terminal as root user. 

> This app conflicts with clevo-xsm-wmi kernel module, and tuxedo_keyboard modules
